# Online Retail Database – SQL Case Study

SQL Server case study using transactional retail sales data to perform data cleaning, create calculated fields, and generate business insights.

## What I Did
- Removed rows with missing Customer_ID
- Removed invalid records (negative quantity/price)
- Removed duplicates using ROW_NUMBER()
- Corrected datatypes and created Total_Sales_Amount
- Built queries for regional sales, monthly/quarterly trends, top products, and customer frequency segmentation
